\begin{abstract}
This manual shows features of graphics in the \textbf{knitr} package
in detail, including the
graphical devices, plot recording, plot rearrangement, control of
plot sizes, the tikz device, figure captions, animations and other
types of plots such as \textbf{rgl} or GGobi plots.

The path and R package dependencies in this project were managed by `Packrat`[^r1] and `knitr`.

# Phenotypic data

## Reformat Sofiane's phenotypic data to a matrix.

## data from external folder were loaded
```{r, eval=F}
source("munge/1.raw_pheno/1.A.1_format_pheno.R")
```

## plot the phentoypic data _per se_

```{r, fig.lp="cor-plot1", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 3, fig.fullwidth = TRUE, fig.cap = "phenotypic data distribution"}
source("profiling/1.pheno/1.A.1_pheno_plot.R")
```

Based on the normality test, the above seven traits show P-values range from c(). Therefore, we have no evidence to reject the normal distribution of the phenotype. 

## Levels of heterosis of the seven traits
```{r,  fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5, fig.fullwidth = TRUE, fig.cap = "Variations of the levels of heterosis"}
source("profiling/1.pheno/1.A.2_pheno_loh_plot.R")

```

## Correlation of the seven phenotypic traits
```{r, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4, fig.cap = "Correlation plot of the seven traits"}
source("profiling/1.pheno/1.A.3_pheno_cor_plot.R")
### get the pheno per se
myp1 <- get_pheno(trait=trait, pheno="valHyb")
pairs(myp1[, 2:8], text.panel = diag, upper.panel=panel.smooth, 
      lower.panel=panel.cor, gap=0, main="", pch=19, col="grey", lwd=2)
```

some words here.

```{r, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4, fig.cap = "Correlation plot of the seven traits"}
source("profiling/1.pheno/1.A.3_pheno_cor_plot.R")
### get percentage of BPHmax
myp2 <- get_pheno(trait=trait, pheno="pBPHmax")
pairs(myp2[, 2:8], text.panel = diag, upper.panel=panel.smooth, 
      lower.panel=panel.cor, gap=0, main="", pch=19, col="grey", lwd=2)

```

some words here.

```{r, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4, fig.cap = "Correlation plot of the seven traits", fig.cap="pMPH"}
source("profiling/1.pheno/1.A.3_pheno_cor_plot.R")
### get percentage of BPHmax
myp3 <- get_pheno(trait=trait, pheno="pMPH")
pairs(myp3[, 2:8], text.panel = diag, upper.panel=panel.smooth, 
      lower.panel=panel.cor, gap=0, main="", pch=19, col="grey", lwd=2)

```





The Tufte-\LaTeX\ [^tufte_latex] document classes define a style similar to the style Edward Tufte uses in his books and handouts. Tufteâ€™s style is known for its extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and well-set typography. 

# Headings

This style provides a- and b-heads (that is, `#` and `##`), demonstrated above.
An error is emitted if you try to use `###` and smaller headings.

\newthought{In his later books}[^books_be], Tufte starts each section with a bit of vertical space, a non-indented paragraph, and sets the first few words of the sentence in small caps. To accomplish this using this style, use the `\newthought` command as demonstrated at the beginning of this paragraph.

# Figures

## Margin Figures

Images and graphics play an integral role in Tufte's work. To place figures or tables in the margin you can use the `fig.margin` knitr chunk option. For example:


Note the use of the `fig.cap` chunk option to provide a figure caption. You can adjust the proportions of figures using the `fig.width` and `fig.height` chunk options. These are specified in inches, and will be automatically scaled down to fit within the handout margin.

## Equations

You can also include \LaTeX\ equations in the margin by explicitly invoking the `marginfigure` environment.

\begin{marginfigure}
$$\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{0}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x).$$
\caption{An equation}
\end{marginfigure}

Note the use of the `\caption` command to add additional text below the equation.

## Full Width Figures

You can arrange for figures to span across the entire page by using the `fig.fullwidth` chunk option. 


Note the use of the `fig.width` and `fig.height` chunk options to establish the proportions of the figure. Full width figures look much better if their height is minimized.

## Main Column Figures

Besides margin and full width figures, you can of course also include figures constrained to the main column.


# Sidenotes

One of the most prominent and distinctive features of this style is the extensive use of sidenotes. There is a wide margin to provide ample room for sidenotes and small figures. Any use of a footnote will automatically be converted to a sidenote. ^[This is a sidenote that was entered using a footnote.] 

If you'd like to place ancillary information in the margin without the sidenote mark (the superscript number), you can use the `\marginnote` command. \marginnote{This is a margin note.  Notice that there isn't a number preceding the note.}

Note also that the two footnote references (`tufte_latex` and `books_be`, both defined below) were also included in the margin on the first page of this document.

# Tables

You can use the **xtable** package to format \LaTeX\ tables that integrate well with the rest of the Tufte handout style. Note that it's important to set the `xtable.comment` and `xtable.booktabs` options as shown below to ensure the table is formatted correctly for inclusion in the document.

```{r, results='asis'}
library(xtable)
options(xtable.comment = FALSE)
options(xtable.booktabs = TRUE)
xtable(head(mtcars[,1:6]), caption = "First rows of mtcars")
```
