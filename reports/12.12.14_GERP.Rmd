# Three strategies in using GERP for Genomic Prediction
Select SNPs with high GERP score according to three roles listed below:  
1. Conserved segments    
2. IBD Region  
3. Physical position  

## Conserved segments

```{r, eval=F}
### load the GERP element data
source("../profiling/4.GERP-GS/4.4.A_gerp_cregion.R")
```

A total of `29,869,451` conserved elements were identified, which accounted for `1.4%` of the total genomic space.  
From these conserved regions, we randomly selected 1,000 SNPs with GERP score >2 for genomic prediction. A random set of 1,000 SNPs were selected from unconserved genomic regions.
