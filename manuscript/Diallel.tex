\section*{Abstract}

%The story is: I have a partial diallel cross with both phenotypic and genotypic data and I observe over dominance at haplotypic level but at the SNP level; everything is explained by dominance. 

Genomic selection (GS) has gained popularity recently as the availability of genome-wide markers has increased. Current methods for GS weigh all the available SNPs equally in model training, without considering their functional differences. Genetic variations detected at evolutionary conserved sites tend to be deleterious and, thus, may be more informative for GS. To utilize this kind of information as a prior into the GS model, we proposed a method to put more weight on evolutionarily constrained sites. As a proof-of-concept, a half diallel population based on 12 diverse inbred lines was used, from which seven phenotypic traits were collected. Some of these traits show high levels of heterosis. After sequencing the 12 founder lines, about 14 million SNPs were discovered and the SNPs were used to identify 502,913 haplotype blocks shared through identity by descent (IBD). A five fold cross-validation experiment was conducted using the summary statistics of the SNP conservation scores, which were computed by evaluating sequences similarity of multiple divergent species, in the IBD blocks as explanatory variables. The results show that the prediction accuracies are significantly better than shuffled data with randomly assigned conservation scores. This study demonstrates the importance of incorporating evolutionary information in GS and its potential use in plant breeding.

%\textbf{Prediction approach for deleterious alleles} 

\textbf{Why we care about deleterious variants. Discuss results of Mezmouk 2014. We are extending this in three ways}  
\begin{itemize}
  \item all deleterious SNPs not just coding
  \item genome-wide not just reduced representation
  \item using GS to test whether they improve prediction
\end{itemize}


%\textbf{Heterosis was observed long time ago. many theories were proposed to explain it.}

The phenomenon of heterosis or hybrid vigor, referring to the superior performance of hybrids as compared to their parents, was initially documented by Darwin and rediscovered by Shull and East in 1908 \citep{Duvick2001}. This phenomenon has been observed for many species across taxa, from yeast \citep{Shapira2014} to vertebrates \citep{Gama2013}. Although heterosis has been broadly applied for food production and has been extensively studied by many researchers, the underlying mechanism controlling for it remains elusive. Recent studies indicated that the complementation of the deleterious alleles, which fit the classical dominance genetic model, may play an important role in determining heterosis \citep{Charlesworth2009}. 

Deleterious alleles were arisen from new mutations during meiosis. In maize, about 90 new mutations were generated per meiosis \citep{Clark2005}, majority of which were deemed to be deleterious according to empirical estimates \citep{Joseph2004}. In a natural outcross population, the negative effects on fitness of these deleterious alleles make them subject to be selected against. Therefore, deleterious alleles were mainly maintained in a low frequency \citep{Eyre-Walker2007}. 

%\textbf{Many new mutations, most deleterious}

%~90 mutations per meiosis (Clark et al. 2005 MBE, Jiao et al. 2012 Nature Genetics), maize HapMap2 new mutations of large effect (Hufford et al 2012 Nature Genetics, Soletzki 2011 MBE).
%Purifying selection retards recovery of diversity in genic regions.

%pesudo-overdominance model
In maize, the total number of these mildly deleterious mutations is substantial because of the exponential growth of population size after domestication. The modern breeding aims to remove these deleterious mutations and pyramiding beneficial alleles for agronomical purposes. In practice, the relatively homogeneous maize germplasm pool was artificially divided into different heterotic groups \citep{Heerwaarden2012}. It enabled the germplasm improvement could be conducted in a parallel fashion. By doing this, the maize yield has been steadily improved since the early 20th century \yang{citation}. However, the removing of deleterious mutations in low recombination regions or in tightly linked regions is less effective. Studies indicated that residual heterozygosity correlates negatively with recombination \citep{Gore2009, McMullen2009} and the low recombination is effective over long period of time \citep{Haddrill2007}. As a consequence, the deleterious alleles would be accumulated in the pericentromeric region and the vigorous performance could only be realized by combining two sets of non-deleterious or beneficial alleles in repulsion state, thus lead to pesudo-overdominance. Recent QTL study identified loci controlling for heterosis are enriched in centromeric regions \citep{Lariepe2012}, which may support this pesudo-overdominance hypothesis.

To study the relationship between deleterious variants, especially those with minor effect or rare in the population, and their contribution to heterosis, a diallel population was employed \citep{}. This diallel population enabled us to invistigate the different modes of inheritance of the deleterious variant in a hybrid population with super dense SNP markers; while only relative little sequencing efforts need to be conducted on founder lines. Our previous study observed that an excess of deleterious SNPs were enriched in GWAS set \citep{Mezmouk2014}. In that study, deleterious variants were defined as nonsynonymous mutations. Clearly, deleterious varinats are not limitted to coding regions. Here, we expanded the characterization of deleterious variants to genome wide by using genomic evolutionary rate profiling (GERP) \citep{Cooper2005}. GERP scores were obtained by computing the regected substitutions subtracted by the neutral rate after multiple sequence alignment of a set of related species \citep{Davydov2010}. \yang{Sofina's GWAS results.}. Because most of the deleterious alleles are rare, their effects are difficult to be detected by traditional GWAS approach. To overcome it, a genomic selection approach was conceived, which enable us to estimate the combined effects of all the possible deleterious variants simuteously. As the results, genomic selection with GERP score incorporated in the prediction model show better performance than circular shuffled data for some phentoypic traits. This study demonstrates the importance of incorporating evolutionary information in genomic selection and its potential use in plant breeding.

Some prior knowledge have not been used for model training. 
SNPs with high GERP score were considered as evolutionary conserved. The mutation at these sites tend to be deleterious. However, because SNPs with high GERP score are negatively correlated with the MAF (Figure and citation), they become less useful due to statistical limitation (citation). To capture the information carried by these potentially deleterious sites, we conducted the genomic-enabled prediction with the SNP's GERP score. 

The population in this study is relative small with only 66 individuals. The 20k conserved SNPs are highly colinear with others. To solve this problem, we use the haplotype-based approach for model training, where the haplotype was coded with the SNP conservation score as the explainatory variables. 

With a 5-fold cross-validation approach, the prediction accuracies of the real data and cicularly shuffled data were compared. To rule out the prossibility that genic SNPs are more conserved than intergenic ones. We elected the SNPs in genic regions and did the circular shuffling to random assign GERP scores the the same set of the selected SNPs.



Current methods for GS weigh all the available SNPs equally in model training, without considering their functional differences. Genetic variations detected at evolutionary conserved sites tend to be deleterious and, thus, may be more informative for GS. To utilize this kind of information as a prior into the GS model, we proposed a method to put more weight on evolutionarily constrained sites. As a proof-of-concept, a half diallel population based on 12 diverse inbred lines was used, from which seven phenotypic traits were collected. Some of these traits show high levels of heterosis.

\section*{Discussion}
%----------------------------------------


\begin{itemize}
  \item how do results match with heritability and heterosis?
  \item do we support deleterious model of Mezmouk et al.?
\end{itemize}

In this study, more than 500,000 deleterious SNPs were identified in elite maize lines including in noncoding regions of the genome. Majority of them were maintained in a low frequency, which consistent with the previous observation \yang{Eli PNAS, 2015} and indicate the deleteriousness of the variants in the conserved sites. A genomic selection pipeline was developed, which utilized evolutionary conservation information in the model.
Cross-validation results suggested prediction accuracies for some traits could be significantly improved by incorporating GERP scores.

\section*{Materials and methods}
%----------------------------------------

\subsection*{Plant material and phenotypic data}
%-------------------
Twelve maize inbred lines were selected and crossed in a partial diallel fashion without considering reciprocal effects \sme{(CITE)}. Ten of these inbreds (LH1, LH123HT, LH82, PH207, 4676A, PHG39, PHG47, PHG84, PHJ40, PHZ51) are proprietary inbreds that have expired from Plant Variety Protection (PVP) and represent the lineage of key heterotic germplasm pools used in present-day commercial corn hybrids, and two are predominant public inbreds B73 and Mo17. This diallel facilitated the creation of F1 hybrids that are adapted to the U.S., fairly elite in performance, and commercially relevant. The set is diverse enough to facilitate a broad sweep of the heterotic sub-groups that comprise U.S. commercial germplasm. \\

The experimental design includes the 66 F1 hybrids, the 12 inbred parents, and 2 current commercial check hybrids grown in an incomplete block design with 3 replications; hybrids and inbreds were grouped separately. The test was grown at Urbana, IL in 2009, 2010, and 2011.  Plots consisted of 4 rows, with all observations taken from the inside 2 rows to minimize effects of shading and maturity differences from adjacent plots. Both inbred lines and the 66 resulting hybrids were field evaluated. Phenotypic data was collected for plant height (PHT, in cm), ear height (EHT, in cm), days to 50\% silking (DTS), days to 50\% pollen shed (DTP), anthesis-silking interval (ASI, in days), grain yield adjusted to 15.5\% moisture (adj GY, in bu/A), and test weight (TWT, in pounds) \sme{(CITE)}.% Question for RHM: Should we cite a paper for the phenotypic data? 

\subsection*{Analyses}
%-------------------

\subsubsection*{Inbred line sequencing and SNP callings}

% wet lab
DNA from the twelve inbred lines was CTAB extracted \citep{Doyle1987} and Covaris sheared for Illumina library preparation. The DNA libraries were then sequenced to an average coverage of 10X \sme{(say where the sequencing was done?)}.

%Read mapping
Raw paired reads (reverse and forward for each sequence), were trimmed for adapter contamination with Scythe package (\url{https://github.com/vsbuffalo/scythe}) which calculate the probability of having a contamination given the adapter sequence, the number of mismatches and sequence quality. The reads were then trimmed for quality and sequence length ($\geq 20$ nucleotides) with Sickle package (\url{https://github.com/najoshi/sickle}) .

Read pairs, kept after filtering,  were mapped to the maize B73 reference genome (AGPv2) with bwa-mem \citep{Li2009B}. Reads, with mapping quality (MAPQ) higher than 10 and with a best alignment score higher than the second best one, were kept for further analyses.

%SNP calling
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were called with mpileup from samtools utilities \citep{Li2009}. To deal with paralogy, which is a major problem in maize sequence mapping \citep{Chia2012}, all SNPs were filtered to a) be heterozygote in less than 3 inbred lines, b) have a mean minor allele depth over all genomes of at least 4, c) have a mean depth over all individuals lower than 30 and d) have missing/heterozygote alleles in less than 6 inbred lines (allelic information for at least 15 hybrids in the partial diallel design). 

%SNP results after filtering
After filtering 13,782,809 are kept for further comparisons, including 1,909,416 genic SNPs and 361,280 in protein coding regions). \\
We estimated the allelic error rate by first comparing our genotype calls to those of 41,292 overlapping SNPs on the maize SNP50 bead chip \citep{Heerwaarden2012};  we then compared our SNP alleles for B73 and Mo17 with the 10,426,715 SNP previously identified in HapMap2 \citep{Chia2012}; finally, we compared our SNPs to 180,313 overlapping SNPs identified through Genotyping by sequencing \citep{Romay2013}. The comparisons showed 99.12\% allele similarity with shared SNPs previously identified. 


\subsubsection*{Haplotype identification and SNP annotation}

%IBD
All missing alleles were then imputed with BEAGLE package \citep{Browning2009} and identity by descent regions (IBD) between the 12 inbred lines were identified with BEAGLE's fastIBD method \citep{Browning2011}. The pairwise IBD region starts and ends were used to delimit haplotipic blocs where several inbred lines shared a homogenous haplotypes.%I need to clarify this last sentence.

%SIFT and MAPP
The SNPs were annotated as synonymous and non-synonymous with the software polydNdS from the analysis package of libsequence  \citep{Thornton2003} using the first transcript of each gene in B73 5b filtered gene set. Deleterious effects of amino acid changes were then predicted with both SIFT \citep{Ng2003, Ng2006} and MAPP \citep{Stone2005} software packages as described by \citep{Mezmouk2014}.

%GERP
Genomic evolutionary rate profiling (GERP) \sme{CITE}, which estimates the evolutionary constraint by quantifying substitution deficits after multiple genome alignments, was obtained from \yang{cite eli2015} for AGPv2. 



\subsubsection*{Phenotypic data analyses}

Best Linear Unbiased Estimation (BLUE) of the genetic effects were calculated with ASReml-R \sme{(CITE)} following the linear model \yang{check the following mixed linear model?}: 
%
\[y_{ijkl} = \mu + \varsigma_{i} + \delta_{ij} + \beta_{jk} + \alpha_{l} +  \varsigma_{i} \cdot \alpha_{l} + \varepsilon\]
%
where 
$y_{ijkl}$ is the phenotypic value of the $l^{th}$ genotype evaluated in the $k^{th}$ block of the $j^{th}$ replicate within the $i^{th}$ environment; 
$\mu$, the overall mean; 
$\varsigma_{i}$, the fixed effect of the $i^{th}$ environment;
$\delta_{ij}$, the fixed effect of the $j^{th}$ replicate nested in the $i^{th}$ environment; 
$\beta_{jk}$, the random effect of the $k^{th}$ block nested in the $j^{th}$ block; 
$\alpha_{l}$, the the fixed genetic effect  of the $l^{th}$ individual; 
$\varsigma_{i} \cdot \alpha_{l}$, the interaction effect of the $l^{th}$ individual with the $i^{th}$ environment; 
$\varepsilon$, the model residuals.

All fixed effects, including the genotype onces, were significant (Wald test p-value<0.05) for all traits except ASI for which the effect of the replicates within environments were not significant.

Heterosi for each hybrid was then estimated by both best- and mid-parent heterosis ($BPH$ and $MPH$, respectively):
%
\[ MPH_{ij}=\hat{G_{ij}}-\frac{1}{2}(\hat{G_{i}}+\hat{G_{j}}) \]
\[ BPH_{min,ij}=\hat{G_{ij}}-min(\hat{G_{i}} ,\hat{G_{j}}) \] 
\[ BPH_{max,ij}=\hat{G_{ij}}-max(\hat{G_{i}} ,\hat{G_{j}}) \]
%
where $\hat{G_{ij}}$, $\hat{G_{i}}$ and $\hat{G_{j}}$ are the genetic values of the hybrid and its two parents $i$ and $j$. $BPH_{min}$ was used instead of $BPH_{max}$ for days to anthesis.\\

Finally, general and specific combining ability (GCA ans SCA) respectively were estimated following \citet{Falconer1996}.

\subsubsection*{Association mapping}
SNP association with heterosis (BPH and MPH) was tested assuming dominance/recessivity of the reference allele or assuming overdominance where only the heterozygote alleles are expected to be significant. For each SNP, root mean square error were used to select the best fitting model. 
Haplotype association with heterosis were tested comparing the heterozygote alleles to all homozygote ones all confounded. 


\subsubsection*{Genomic-enabled prediction with GERP score}

A haplotype based genomic selection (GS) strategy was conceived by using the IBD blocks as the explanatory variables containing conservation information. The reference genome sites with GERP score />0 were considered as conserved sites and genomic variations at these sites were deemed as deleterious. To incoporate the conservation information into IBD blocks, SNPs falling into a given IBD block were added up using their GERP scores as the conservation estimates of the IBD block. This estimation was calculated using a python script gerpIBD (\url{https://github.com/RILAB/pvpDiallel}) with additive and dominant models. Under the additive model, 2 x GERP score was assigned to the homozygous loci with non-reference SNP calls; 1 x GERP score was assigned to the heterozygous loci; and 0 was assigned to the homozygous loci with reference SNP calls. Under the dominant model, 1 x GERP score was assigned to both the homzygous loci with non-reference SNP calls and heterozygous loci; 0 was assigned to homozygous loci with reference SNP calls.



seven phenotypic traits were trained with the conservation statistics in IBD block as genotype.
A Bayesian-based approach, BayesC \sme{CITE}, was employed for the GS experiments. To conduct predict, the diallel population was randomly divided into training and validation sets for 10 times according to a 5-fold cross-validation method. First, the BayesC model was trained independently on each of the training set. Second, the prediction accuracy was obtained by comparing the predicted and observed phenotypes on the conresponding validation set. 


In addition, the GERP scores were circularly shuffled. The cross-validation experiments using the circularly shuffled data were conducted on the same training and validation sets.
