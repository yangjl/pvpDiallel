\correspondingauthor{Jeffrey Ross-Ibarra}

\begin{abstract}
Complementation of the deleterious alleles carried by the inbred parents may contribute to the vigorous performance, or heterosis, of the hybrid progenies. The detection of deleterious alleles was previous limited to the protein-coding regions. With the genomic evolutionary rate profiling (GERP), we extended the definition of deleterious alleles to the genome-wide. In total, about 86 million base-pairs, which make up 4.2\% of the maize genome, were detected as evolutionary conserved sequences in both genic and non-genic regions. Here we take advantage of evolutionary measures of sequence conservation to ask whether sites with prior evidence of functionality can inform genomic selection (GS) models. We tested this idea using a partial diallel cross of 12 maize inbred lines. We sequenced the genomes of the parents and phenotyped both parents and hybrids for seven phenotypic traits across one environment in three years. We made use of an identity-by-decent analysis of the parents to identify haplotype blocks, and scored blocks in hybrids using a weighted sum of the GERP conservation score. We find that incorporating sequence conservation improves prediction accuracies in a five-fold cross-validation experiment for several traits \emph{per se} as well as heterosis for those traits. Because most variation at conserved sites is deleterious, we interpret these results as consistent with the simple complementation model for heterosis. Overall, this work demonstrates the importance of incorporating evolutionary information in GS and its potential usage in plant breeding.

\lettrine[lines=2]{\color{color2}T}{}he phenomenon of heterosis or hybrid vigor has been observed across many species, from yeast \citep{Shapira2014} to plants \citep{shull1908composition} and vertebrates \citep{Gama2013}. 
A number of hypotheses have been put forth to explain the phenomenon, including gene dosage \citep{birchler2003search}, overdominance \citep{east1936heterosis, schwartz1973single, krieger2010flowering} or pseudo-overdomiance \citep{graham1997characterization, McMullen2009}, and epistasis \citep{minvielle1987dominance, schnell1992multiplicative}. Complementation of recessive deleterious alleles, however, remains the simplest genetic explanation \citep{Charlesworth2009}, and is supported by considerable empirical evidences \citep{xiao1995dominance, frascaroli2007classical, huang2015genomic}.

Deleterious alleles were arisen from new mutations during meiosis. In maize, about 90 new mutations were generated per meiosis \citep{Clark2005}, majority of which were deleterious according to empirical estimates \citep{Joseph2004}. In a natural outcross population, the negative effects on fitness of these deleterious alleles make them subject to be selection against, which lead the deleterious alleles to be maintained in a low frequency \citep{Eyre-Walker2007}. But the deleterious alleles could not be completely purged. 

In maize, the total number of mildly deleterious mutations is substantial because of the exponential growth of population size after domestication. The modern breeding probably aims to remove these deleterious mutations and pyramiding beneficial alleles for agronomical purposes. In practice, the relatively homogeneous maize germplasm pool was artificially divided into different heterotic groups \citep{Heerwaarden2012}. It enabled the improvement of germplasm pools to be conducted in a parallel fashion, and therefore, facilitated the breeding efficiency. Using this hybrid breeding approach, the maize yield has been steadily improved since the early 20th century \citep{duvick2001biotechnology}. However, removing deleterious mutations in low recombination regions or in tightly linked regions become less effective. Studies indicated that residual heterozygosity correlates negatively with recombination \citep{Gore2009, McMullen2009} and the low recombination is effective over long period of time \citep{Haddrill2007}. As a consequence, the deleterious alleles would be accumulated in the low recombination regions, such as the pericentromeric regions in maize, and the vigorous performance could be realized by combining two sets of non-deleterious or beneficial alleles in repulsion state, thus lead to pesudo-overdominance. A recent QTL study identified loci controlling for heterosis are enriched in centromeric regions \citep{Lariepe2012}, which partly support this pesudo-overdominance hypothesis.

Despite the importance of deleterious alleles in contributing to heterosis, they have not been systematically investigated probably because of their low frequencies in the population and mostly exhibiting minor effects. Here, we employed a genomic selection (GS) approach to simultaneously estimate genome-wide deleterious variants in a half diallel population. The diallel population was composed of a set of hybrids, which enabled us to explore different modes of inheritance of the deleterious variants. And the study can be conducted with millions of variants but using relative little sequencing efforts. In our previous study, deleterious SNPs were found to be enriched in a SNP set identified by GWAS \citep{Mezmouk2014}. The deleterious variants in the study were defined as non-synonymous mutations in the coding regions. Clearly, deleterious variants are not limited to coding regions. Here, we expanded the characterization of deleterious variants to genome-wide using genomic evolutionary rate profiling (GERP) \citep{Cooper2005}. By incorporating GERP information in GS models, we demonstrated the prediction accuracies were significantly improved not only for some traits \emph{per se}, but aslo for some heterosis transformations (especially for traits exhibiting high levels of hereosis). Further studies indicated that joint effects of deleterious alleles with additive and dominant modes of inheritance may contribute to heterosis.


\section*{Materials and Methods} 

\subsection*{Plant materials and phenotypic data}
We selected 12 maize inbred lines, broadly representative of corn belt maize germplasm \citep{mikel2006evolution}, as parents of a partial diallel population. 
Each parent in a cross was used as both male and female and the resulting seed was bulked. 
We evaluated the 66 F1 hybrids, 12 inbred parents and two current commercial check hybrids in the field in Urbana, IL over three years (2009-2011) in an incomplete block design with three replicates each year.  
Plots consisted of four rows, with all observations taken from the inside two rows to minimize effects of shading and maturity differences from adjacent plots.  
We measured plant height (PHT, in cm), ear height (EHT, in cm), days to 50\% silking (DTS), days to 50\% pollen shed (DTP), anthesis-silking interval (ASI, in days), grain yield adjusted to 15.5\% moisture (adj GY, in bu/A), and test weight (TW, in pounds). 
Overall mean phenotypic values for each cross can be found at Table S\ref{table:table_s1} (\url{https://github.com/RILAB/pvpDiallel/blob/master/manuscript/SI/Table_S1.trait_matrix.csv}).

We estimated Best Linear Unbiased Estimates (BLUEs) of the genetic effects in ASReml-R \citep{gilmour2009asreml} with the following linear model: 
\[Y_{ijkl} = \mu + \varsigma_{i} + \delta_{ij} + \beta_{jk} + \alpha_{l} +  \varsigma_{i} \cdot \alpha_{l} + \varepsilon\]
where 
$Y_{ijkl}$ is the phenotypic value of the $l^{th}$ genotype evaluated in the $k^{th}$ block of the $j^{th}$ replicate within the $i^{th}$ year; 
$\mu$, the overall mean; 
$\varsigma_{i}$, the fixed effect of the $i^{th}$ year;
$\delta_{ij}$, the fixed effect of the $j^{th}$ replicate nested in the $i^{th}$ year; 
$\beta_{jk}$, the random effect of the $k^{th}$ block nested in the $j^{th}$ replicate; 
$\alpha_{l}$, the the fixed genetic effect  of the $l^{th}$ individual; 
$\varsigma_{i} \cdot \alpha_{l}$, the interaction effect of the $l^{th}$ individual with the $i^{th}$ year; 
$\varepsilon$, the model residuals. 

We estimated best-parent heterosis (BPH) as:
\[ BPH_{min,ij}=\hat{G_{ij}}-min(\hat{G_{i}} ,\hat{G_{j}}) \] 
\[ BPH_{max,ij}=\hat{G_{ij}}-max(\hat{G_{i}} ,\hat{G_{j}}) \]
where $\hat{G_{ij}}$, $\hat{G_{i}}$ and $\hat{G_{j}}$ are the genetic values of the hybrid and its two parents $i$ and $j$. $BPH_{min}$ was used instead of $BPH_{max}$ for ASI. \jri{what about ear height and DTS?} \yang{Did you mean plant height? We need to discuss about this.} \DIFaddbegin \jri{no plant height should be max, ear height maybe should be min? though it is correlated with plant height... happy to discuss}
\DIFaddend 

\subsection*{Sequencing and Genotyping}

We extracted DNA from the 12 inbred lines following \citet{Doyle1987} and sheared the DNA on a Covaris (Woburn, Massachusetts) for library preparation. \jri{do we need details on library prep? at least a citation?}
Libraries were then sequenced \jri{where? what length reads? insert size?}. \yang{who did the wet lab? Do we need to add him/her as co-author?} \DIFaddbegin \jri{Kate Guill. I'll ask.}
\DIFaddend 

We trimmed raw sequence reads for adapter contamination with Scythe  (\url{https://github.com/vsbuffalo/scythe}) and for quality \DIFaddbegin \jri{what qual score?} \DIFaddend and sequence length ($\geq 20$ nucleotides) with Sickle (\url{https://github.com/najoshi/sickle}). 
We mapped filtered reads to the maize B73 reference genome (AGPv2) with bwa-mem \citep{Li2009B}, keeping reads with mapping quality (MAPQ) higher than 10 and with a best alignment score higher than the second best one for further analyses.
We called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using the $mpileup$ function from \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend samtools utilities \citep{Li2009}. 
To deal with known issues with paralogy in maize \citep{Chia2012}, SNPs were filtered to be heterozygote in less than 3 inbred lines, have a mean minor allele depth of at least 4, have a mean depth over all individuals lower than 30 and have missing/heterozygote alleles in fewer than 6 inbred lines. 

We used the fastIBD method implemented in BEAGLE \citep{Browning2009} to impute missing data and identify regions of identity by descent (IBD) between the 12 inbred lines. 
We then defined haplotype blocks as contiguous regions within which there were no IBD break points across all pairwise comparisons of the parental lines (Figure \ref{fig:defineibd}). \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{IBD blocks at least 1 Kb in size were kept for further analysis. 
}\DIFaddend 




\subsection*{Genomic selection using IBD blocks incorporated with GERP scores}

We used genome-wide estimates of evolutionary constraint \citep[GERP][]{Davydov2010} estimated by \citet{rodgers2015recombination}. 
Haplotype blocks were weighted by the summed GERP scores of all deleterious (GERP score $>0$) SNPs\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{; blocks with no deleterious SNPs were excluded from further analysis}\DIFaddend . 
This estimation was calculated under both additive and dominant modes of inheritance using a custom python script available at (\url{https://github.com/yangjl/zmSNPtools}). 
For a particular SNP with a GERP score $g$, the non-reference homozygote was assigned a value of $2g$, the heterozygote a value of $g$, and the reference homozygote a value of 0.  
Under the dominant model, both the heterozygote and the non-reference homozygote were assigned a value of $g$, with the reference homozygote again assigned a value of 0.
To conduct prediction, a 5-fold cross-validation method was used, dividing the diallel population  randomly  into training (80\%) and validation sets (20\%)  10 times. 
The BayesC option from GenSel4 \citep{habier2011extension} was used for model training, using 41,000 iterations and removing the first 1,000 as burn-in. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdelend After model training, prediction accuracies were obtained by comparing the predicted breeding values with the observed phenotypes in the corresponding validation sets. 
For comparison, GERP scores were \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{circularly shuffled by }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{permuted using }\DIFaddend 50k \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{SNPs windows }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{SNP }\DIFaddend ($> 100$Mb) \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{windows which were circularly shuffled }\DIFaddend 10 times to estimate a null conservation score for each IBD blocks. 
Cross-validation experiments using the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{circularly shuffled }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{permuted }\DIFaddend data were conducted on the same training and validation sets.  





\section*{Results}


\subsection*{Genetic values, heritability and heterosis}

A partial diallel population was created using 12 maize inbred lines (Figure \ref{fig:pvp-pheno}a). 
Two of them are important public inbreds, B73 and Mo17. And the other ten of proprietary inbreds (LH1, LH123HT, LH82, PH207, 4676A, PHG39, PHG47, PHG84, PHJ40, and PHZ51) that have expired from Plant Variety Protection (PVP) and represent much of the lineage of key heterotic germplasm pools used in present-day commercial corn hybrids. 
From this population, phenotypic data were collected for seven traits of interest during 2009-2011: anthesis-silking interval (ASI, in days), days to 50\% pollen shed (DTP), days to 50\% silking (DTS), ear height (EHT, in cm), grain yield adjusted to 15.5\% moisture (GY, in bu/A), plant height (PHT, in cm), and test weight (TW, in pounds).

Best linear unbiased estimators (BLUEs) for genotypes of the seven traits were derived from mixed linear models (Table S1). \DIFaddbegin \jri{add ref to table}
\DIFaddend In the models, all fixed effects were significant (Wald test \emph{P} value $<0.05$) for all traits except ASI, for which the effect of replicates within environments were not significant. 
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:pvp-pheno}b, BLUE values were normally distributed (normality test \emph{P} values $>0.05$). \DIFaddbegin \jri{i like part b of this figure, do you think it should be a main text figure?}
\DIFaddend Broad sense heritability for these traits ranged from 0.65 for ASI to 0.95 for PHT. 
Using the parental phenotypic data, we then estimated best-parent heterosis (BPH) for each trait.  
Because the selected inbred lines are commercially relevant and fairly elite in performance, hybrids in this population exhibit relatively low hybrid vigor (overall mean percent BPH = 0.3\% $\pm$ 0.4\%) for most traits except GY (mean percent BPH = 95\% $\pm$ 16\%, Figure \ref{fig:pBPH}). 
Finally, general and specific combining ability (GCA and SCA) were estimated following \citep{Falconer1996}. 
GCA and SCA varied among traits \href{run:https://github.com/RILAB/pvpDiallel/tree/master/manuscript/SI/Table_S2.CA.csv}{(Table S2)}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdelend , but B73, PHG47 and PHG39 showed the greatest GCA \DIFdelbegin \DIFdelend for grain yield.

\subsection*{\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Evolutionary }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Sequence variation and evolutionary }\DIFaddend constraint\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{information for genomic variants}\DIFdelend }

All twelve inbreds were sequenced to an average depth of $\sim$10X, resulting in a filtered set of 13.8 million SNPs. 
We estimated the allelic error rate using three independent data sets: for all individuals using 41,292 overlapping SNPs on the maize SNP50 bead chip \citep{Heerwaarden2012}; for all individuals using 180,313 overlapping SNPs identified through genotyping by sequencing (GBS) \citep{Romay2013}; and for B73 and Mo17 using the 10,426,715 SNP from the HapMap2 project \citep{Chia2012}.  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdelend Compared to corresponding SNPs identified by previous studies, a concordance rate of 99.1\% was observed. \DIFaddbegin \jri{can we separate those numbers out by study? or just report for one study and mention that similar rates were seen in other studies? either way it would be nice to know what rate went with what data. also is concordance mean identical genotype? do we have minor allele rate (which is a bit more informative)? if not, skip it.}
\DIFaddend 

More than 86 million bp of the genome were annotated as conserved, with GERP scores $>0$.
Nonetheless, 506,898 of these sites were found to segregate among the 12 inbred parents of our diallel (Figure \ref{fig:gerpmaf}A and \ref{fig:dis1m}).
The minor allele frequency of SNPs at conserved sites was negatively correlated with GERP score (Figure \ref{fig:gerpmaf}B; \emph{P} value < 0.05, \emph{r} = $-0.8$), consistent with the idea that variants at sites with more positive GERP scores are more deleterious and more strongly impacted by purifying selection.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Genomic variants occurred at the evolutionary constraint sites were potentially deleterious. The phenotypic effects of these genetic loads and their contributions to heterosis become an interesting area to explore.

The statistical power to detect the separate effects of these putative deleterious alleles becomes very low}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The small sample size of our diallel and the general low frequency of deleterious SNPs precludes association-based approaches to evaluate the impact of variants on phenotypic variation}\DIFaddend .
To alleviate \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the statistical limitations}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{this limitation}\DIFaddend , we conceived a haplotype-based \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{approach for GS, which could add up }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{genomic selection approach in which we use estimates of evolutionary constraint across the genome \mbox{\citep{rodgers2015recombination}
}to sum the }\DIFaddend individual effects of deleterious alleles \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in IBD blocks and estimate these IBD blocks simultaneously. To conduct the analysis, first of all, 55,000 IBD blocks were identified, which had an average size of 44,980 bp (ranged from 36 to 10,320,000 bp). IBD blocks having > 1-kb in size and containing > 1 deleterious alleles (SNPs at sites with GERP scores >0) were kept for further analysis. Secondly, the GERP scores of SNPs in an IBD block were summed under both }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{within IBD blocks under both an }\DIFaddend additive and dominant \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{models. Those summed GERP scores on IBD blocks were considered as the measurements of the conservation of the haplotypes. More details of this procedure were illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:gerpibd}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{model (see Methods and Figure \ref{fig:gerpibd})}\DIFaddend . 

A Bayesian-based statistical method (BayesC) \citep{habier2011extension} \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{using a 5-fold cross-validation approachwas }\DIFaddend was employed for model training. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Using a 5-fold cross-validation approach, the prediction accuracies of the real data and cicularly shuffled data were compared.

\DIFadd{Incorporating evolutionary constraint information improved prediction accuracy }\DIFaddend for ASI and PHT \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{when incorporating GERP information in the IBD blocks under the additive model ; prediction accuracy was significantly improved }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \emph{\DIFadd{per se}} \DIFadd{under an additive model and }\DIFaddend for ASI under \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the dominant model .

\subsection*{Posterior phenotypic variance explained and model comparisons}

To learn why the prediction performace varied among traits \emph{per se} and heterosis\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{transformations}\DIFdelend , we obtained the posterior variance explained by our models using the complete set of data. 
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:h2}, additive models explained more phenotypic variance for traits \emph{per se} of DTP, DTS, EHT and PHT; but explained less phenotypic variance for heterosis \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{transformations }\DIFdelend (BPH) of ASI, GY and TW. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{On the contrary, lager proportions }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In contrast, a larger proportion }\DIFaddend of the phenotypic variance could be explained by the dominant models for heterosis \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{transformations }\DIFdelend (BPH) of ASI, GY and TW. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{For the GY in particular, 50}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This difference was particularly striking for grain yield, where only }\X \DIFaddend \% of the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{variance in }\DIFaddend heterosis could be explained \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{by }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{under an additive model but 50\% of the variance was explained by the }\DIFaddend dominant model.

\section*{Discussion}

\begin{itemize}
  \item do we support deleterious model of Mezmouk et al.? \yang{yes}
  \item how do results match with heritability and heterosis? \yang{and mode of inheritance}
  \item Indication for breeding? genomic selection using GERP and other annotation information. 
\end{itemize}


In this study, more than 500,000 deleterious SNPs were identified in elite maize lines. On average, each elite inbred line carries about 100,000 deleterious SNPs (GERP > 0). In the population, however, majority of these deleterious mutations were maintained in a low frequency, which consistent with previous observation \citep{rodgers2015recombination}. The large number of deleterious alleles make it hard to be completely purged through breeding efforts. In practice, part of the genetic loads could be released in F1 hybrids by combining appropriate inbred lines (from pre-defined heterotic groups) to complement deleterious alleles. Indeed, results in this study shown that prediction accuracies were higher for yield heterosis using deleterious SNPs than permuted ones. Because we weighted SNPs with their conservation score in GS model, the improved accuracies could be attributed to deleteriousness of SNP variants. Therefore, it provided evidence of complementation of deleterious alleles for heterosis \citex{}. Note that thousands of deleterious alleles may be involved in the complementation, and most of which may have minor effects. Their effects could not be easily detected by traditional QTL or GWAS \citex{}.

To test hypothesis, we developed a GS pipeline, which incorporated evolutionary conservation information in the GS model. As the genotyping cost keeps declining, GS tends to replace marker assistant selection (MAS) \citex{} in plant breeding \citex{}. Researchers developed a series of statistical approaches to improve the efficiency of GS model \citex{}, however, none of the existing approaches have taken prior biological information into consideration. It is known that SNP variations would have varied impacts depending on their genomic position (e.g. ) \citex{}, biological function (e.g. transcription binding sites) and evolutionary conservation. The incorporation of GERP information under the Bayesian framework developed in this study is the first step towarding more meaningful models for further GS.     

It was not surprised that the current models did not increase the prediction accuacies equally well for traits \emph{per se} and their heterosis transformations. Genetic arachitectures of different phenotypic traits varied in maize and other crop species, e.g., flowering time of maize was determined by many small effect additive loci \citex{} and rice yield was determined by many dominant loci \citex{}. We observed additive model increased the prediction accuacies for trait \emph{per se} of ASI and dominant model increased the prediction accuacies for trait \emph{per se} of GY. Because under current models, we simply assume phenotypic traits were determined by complete additive or complete dominant effects. Traits with mixture effects of additive and dominant loci may fail to be predicted. In addition, the population size was relative small in the model training, we may not have enough power to predict traits with low heritability.

\textbf{Incoporation of conservation information into IBD blocks.}
Regions of the genome that are identical by descent (IBD) among the 12 inbreds were identified using Beagle \citep{Browning2009}.  The GERP scores of SNPs in an IBD block were summed under both additive and dominant models. For a particular SNP with GERP score $g$, the homozygous non-reference genotype was assigned a value of $2g$, the heterozygote assigned a value of $g$, and the reference homozygote a value of 0.  Under the dominant model, both the heterozygote and the non-reference homozygote were assigned a value of $g$, with the reference homozygote again assigned a value of 0.}
