Welcome to Project PVP Diallel!


### Notes from Sofiane 10/13/2014
```
Here are the links to the data: 

Genetic values, MPH, BPH and combining abilities: "/group/jrigrp2/DiallelSofiane/GeneticValues/"

"GCA-SCA*.txt" are the combining abilities (one file per traits)

"Gvalues_*" are the hybrid values with MPH and BPH as well (one file per trait)

"GeneticValuesExPVPdiallelbis" is the file of fitted values that I used to create GCA-SCA and Gvalues. 



We have 7 traits PHT(plant height),	EHT(ear height),	DTS(days to silking),	DTP(Days to pollen),	ASI	Adj.GY (afjusted yield) and TW (Test weight).

The SNP data (only the parents) is in "/group/jrigrp2/DiallelSofiane/BWA/SNPfiles/FinalSNPs_all.txt" 

I also imputed missing alleles with Beagle and the data is in "/group/jrigrp2/DiallelSofiane/BWA/SNPfiles/ImpSNPs_all"

The SNP annotation is in "/group/jrigrp2/DiallelSofiane/BWA/SNPfiles/SNP-DelCall-all.txt"

The hybrid genotypes are in "/group/jrigrp2/DiallelSofiane/BWA/SNPfiles/HetGeno_chr*" with one file per chromosome; it was faster to run the analyses on parallel for all chromosomes and I had them in separate file to limit I/O problems.

Finally,  I have the same hybrid information coded 0/1 in "/group/jrigrp2/DiallelSofiane/BWA/SNPfiles/Het0-1_chr$"
