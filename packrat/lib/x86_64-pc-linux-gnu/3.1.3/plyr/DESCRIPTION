Title: Tools for splitting, applying and combining data
Version: 1.8.1
Author: Hadley Wickham <h.wickham@gmail.com>
Maintainer: Hadley Wickham <h.wickham@gmail.com>
Description: plyr is a set of tools that solves a common set of
    problems: you need to break a big problem down into manageable
    pieces, operate on each pieces and then put all the pieces back
    together.  For example, you might want to fit a model to each
    spatial location or time point in your study, summarise data by
    panels or collapse high-dimensional arrays to simpler summary
    statistics. The development of plyr has been generously supported
    by BD (Becton Dickinson).
