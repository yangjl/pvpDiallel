\section{Changes in ProjectTemplate version 0.5-1 (2014-03-17)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Restore compatibility to R 2.15.3 by avoiding use of the \code{no..} parameter
       to \code{list.files()} in our \code{create.project()} function.
  }
}
\section{Changes in ProjectTemplate version 0.5 (2014-03-13)}{
  \subsection{Features}{
    \itemize{
      \item New function \code{get.project()} to access \code{project.info}.
      \item Attempting to load a missing package when reading data will lead to a
        user-friendly error message (#26).
      \item Export existing \code{translate.dcf} function, useful for implementing custom readers (#59).
      \item Add new function \code{.add.extension.} This allows users to create custom readers
         for extensions, either locally in a project or as packages (#59).
    }
  }
  \subsection{Internal}{
    \itemize{
      \item Fix CRAN warnings concerning use of \code{ProjectTemplate:::} qualification

      \item Updated author information in DESCRIPTION file (#40).
      \item Store templates for empty projects in tar files instead of storing
         the entire directory structure per CRAN request and to avoid having to build
