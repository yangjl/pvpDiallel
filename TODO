Short reminder of what has been done:

Diallel phenotypic data 

analyses of the phenotypic data 

estimates of MPH, BPHmax, BPHmin

estimates of GCA and SCA



Diallel parent sequence data 

sequences mapped to the B73 ref. 

SNP calls and filtering 

IBS estimates with Beagle 

Haplotypic bloc definition 

Synonymous/non synonymous SNP calls 

deleterious SNPs calls (SIFT and MAPP)



Statistics 

GWAS at SNP level 

SNP heterozygosity with heterosis

SNP heterozygosity with heterosis assuming dominance (I included one of the homozygotes with the heterozygotes)

SNPs with the genetic values of the hybrids

SNPs with SCA



GWAS at the Hplotype level

heterozygosity with heterosis 





Summaries of the results:

Number of significant haplotypic blocs for :

different thresholds 

a minimum haplotype count of 5, 10 or 30 

MPH, BPHmax and BPHmins

Comparison of dominance vs additivity for the SNPs for 

different thresholds 

MPH, BPHmax and BPHmins

I looked at significant haplotypic blocs with minimum allele count of at least 5 that are significant (pval<0.0001) and checked what is the better model for significant SNPs (pval<0.001) in the haplotype: dominance or additivity

Check the number of haplotypes in each haplotypic group and identify the polymorphisms and seather that are deleterious
