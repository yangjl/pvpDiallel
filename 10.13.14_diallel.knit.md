# Phenotypic data

## Reformat Sofiane's phenotypic data to a matrix.

## data from external folder were loaded

```r
source("munge/1.raw_pheno/1.A.1_format_pheno.R")
```

## plot the phentoypic data _per se_


```r
source("profiling/1.pheno/1.A.1_pheno_plot.R")
```

\begin{figure*}

\caption{phenotypic data distribution}
\end{figure*}

Based on the normality test, the above seven traits show P-values range from c(). Therefore, we have no evidence to reject the normal distribution of the phenotype. 

## Levels of heterosis of the seven traits
